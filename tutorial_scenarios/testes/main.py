    # Add another app2-instance in allocDefinition.json file adding the next data and run the main.py file again to see the new results:
    # {
    #   "module_name": "2_01",
    #   "app": 2,
    #   "id_resource": 3
    # },
    ## What has happened to the results? Take a look at the network image available in the results folder to understand the "allocation" of app2-related entities.

    # ! IMPORTANT. The scheduler & routing algorithm (aka. selectorPath = DeviceSpeedAwareRouting()) chooses the instance that will attend the request according to the latency -in this case-.
    #  For that reason, the initial instance deployed at node 0 is not used. It is further away than the instance located at node3.
    # Add another app2-user at node 16, add the next json inside of userDefinition.json file and try again. Enjoy it!
